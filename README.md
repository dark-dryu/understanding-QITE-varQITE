# Understanding QITE and varQITE

This repository contains the code of the algorithms presented in the proceeding paper of the [22nd International Conference on Distributed Computing and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.dcai-conference.net/). The work is presented in the Special Session on Quantum computing applied to industry and cybersecurity (QUINCY) and can be found in (pending publication). The details of how this code works can be found inside the published work.

We provide different function files for different computations needed in the algorithms, and two tutorial jupyter notebooks showcasing the use of these functions for the both QITE algorithms. We also provide two standalone jupyter notebooks in the corresponding folder, with just the necessary code to execute each one. Using the Python function files allows to extend the code for other applications.

# Library requirements

These notebooks depend on basic libraries such as NumPy and SciPy, and the qiskit library to perform some operations. Versions qiskit>2 still cause problems because of these versions of qiskit are still in migration process, for that reason please install qiskit==1.4.x

# Code Authors
The code authors are:

- QITE: Andreu Angl√©s-Castillo (@[dark-dryu](https://github.com/dark-dryu/))
- varQITE: Luca Ion (@[LucaYoy](https://github.com/LucaYoy))
